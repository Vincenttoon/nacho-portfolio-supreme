### User Story
 - AS AN employer
 - I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
 - SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

### Acceptance Criteria
 - GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work 
 - WHEN I load their portfolio
 - THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
 - WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
 - THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
 - WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
 - THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
 - WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
 - THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
 - WHEN I click on the images of the applications
 - THEN I am taken to that deployed application
 - WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
 - THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
